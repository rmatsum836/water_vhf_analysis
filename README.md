# Water Van Hove Function Analysis

Python functions and raw data to analyze the Van hove function.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze various water models through the calculation of the
van hove function.  

## Simulation Details
All simulations have been run in the canoncial (constant temperature, volume, and molecules)
ensemble.

## Package Details
Raw van hove function data is contained in the `data` directory.  Plotting and analysis
functions are contained in the `analysis` directory.  A simple unit testing suite is
contained within `tests`.

## Required Packages:
- NumPy
- SciPy
- [MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj)
- [scattering](https://github.com/mattwthompson/scattering)
- matplotlib
- Seaborns
- PyTest (For Testing)

## Docker Image
Docker image is in progress to setup an environment to use the package.
